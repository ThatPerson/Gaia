Gaian Daisyworld.

A extensible model of James Lovelock and Andrew Watson's Daisyworld.
You need to create an output/ folder in order for it to work.

In order to setup Daisyworld run the following commands;

```
git clone https://github.com/ThatPerson/Gaia.git && cd Gaia && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

Now ./gaia can be used as detailed in the manual.
